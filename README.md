# NFQ Front-end assignment
Assigment for the front-end position at NFQ Vilnius.
###Description
The application is a single page user and group content management system. Users are able to add new users and groups, and delete existing ones. There is also a possibility to assign users to multiple groups.
###Technologies used
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript were used as primary means of constructing application.  It is responsive to mobile devices.
##### Javascript libraries used:
  * Require.js (to manage dependencies, make application modular)
  * Backbone.js (for MV pattern, and easy communication with localStorage)
  * Backbone.js LocalStorage Plugin (easier communication with localStorage)
  * Underscore.js (provides useful functions. Used _.each for itteration, _.contains and some other)
  * jQuery (for easier DOM manipulation)
  * Require.js underscore text templates plugin (plugin lets create text based templates to be compiled by underscore templating engine. Easier to manage than inline templates)
  * R.js (for compiling and minifying application via node.js)

I have also used SASS to organize stylesheets. BEM methodology was used for classes' naming.
It took about 6 hours to make the application.
